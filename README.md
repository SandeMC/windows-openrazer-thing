## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- .NET 9.0 Runtime (included in self-contained builds)
- OpenRazer Win32 DLL (included)

## Installation

### Option 1: Pre-built Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Run `RazerController.exe`

### Option 2: Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (for building the native DLL)

#### Building the Native DLL

1. Open `native/OpenRazer.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Select your target platform (x64 or x86)
3. Build the solution (Release configuration)
4. The DLL will be in `native/x64/Release/OpenRazer64.dll` or `native/Release/OpenRazer.dll`

#### Building the Application

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SandeMC/windows-openrazer-thing.git
cd windows-openrazer-thing

# Check if you have all prerequisites
.\check-prerequisites.ps1

# Build the native DLL (requires Visual Studio)
# Open native/OpenRazer.sln and build, or use MSBuild:
msbuild native/OpenRazer.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64

# Build the .NET application
dotnet build RazerController.sln -c Release

# Run the application
dotnet run --project src/RazerController -c Release
```

#### Creating a Self-Contained Executable

```bash
# Windows x64
dotnet publish src/RazerController/RazerController.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true

# The executable will be in: src/RazerController/bin/Release/net9.0/win-x64/publish/
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch the Application**: Run `RazerController.exe`
2. **Initialize Devices**: Click the "Initialize Devices" button
3. **Select a Device**: Click on a device in the left panel
4. **Control Your Device**:
   - Use the RGB sliders to choose a color
   - Click "Set Static Color" to apply it
   - Try other effects like Spectrum or Breath
   - For mice, adjust DPI and polling rate

## Usage

### RGB Lighting

- **Static Color**: Choose RGB values and click "Set Static Color"
- **Spectrum Effect**: Rainbow cycling effect
- **Breath Effect**: Pulsing effect with your chosen color
- **Turn Off**: Disable all lighting
- **Brightness**: Adjust the overall brightness (0-255)

### Mouse Settings

- **DPI**: Set your preferred sensitivity (100-20000)
- **Polling Rate**: Choose from 125Hz, 250Hz, 500Hz, or 1000Hz

### System Tray

- The application minimizes to the system tray when closed
- Right-click the tray icon for options:
  - **Show**: Restore the main window
  - **Exit**: Quit the application
